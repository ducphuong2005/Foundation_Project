<h2>BookStore Website</h2>
The purpose of the website is to sell books online, books including both E-books and printed books. It serves 3 main actors: Customers – the actors buying books from the website, Book Providers – the actors supplying books for the website, Administrator – the actors managing the operation of the website ( including Customers, Book Providers, inventory, sale figure, … ). 

From the Customers’ perspective, the website provides the lists of various books so that Customers can browse and choose the books they like, add to favorite, to cart or purchase. They can choose the type of books they want to get: E-book, Printed book, or both. The purchase process will be handled by a payment system that provides payment methods to Customers. Once the payment system confirms the transactions, Customers will receive a digital bill having all the information of the order. If the chosen book type is E-book, the Customers will receive a soft copy by a link right away; in contrast, the printed book will be delivered to the address of the Customers within the days as committed. In case having problems with the orders, Customers can require support from the provider.

From the Book Providers’ side, the website gives them various tools for managing and operating their online store. They can register new books, add and edit the existing books in their storefront, manage the customers’ orders like tracking delivery route, refund orders or support Customers. Sales figures will be presented in the Book Provider’s Dashboard under the Sales Report section, filtered by days, weeks, months and years.

From the Administrator’s perspective, the website allows them to manage the overall operation of the platform. Administrators can control user accounts of both Customers and Book Providers, ensuring that only authorized actors can access the system. They are responsible for monitoring and updating the book inventory, verifying the accuracy of book information, and removing inappropriate content if necessary. Administrators also supervise the order process, handle disputes, and provide support whenever issues between Customers and Book Providers arise. In addition, the website provides Administrators with reporting and analytics tools to track sales performance, revenue statistics, and system activities, which help them make decisions for improving the platform’s efficiency and reliability.
